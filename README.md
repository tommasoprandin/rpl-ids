# IDS

A simple RPL network with UDP communication. This is a self-contained example:
it includes a DAG root (`udp-server.c`) and DAG nodes (`udp-clients.c`).
This example runs without a border router -- this is a stand-alone RPL network.

The DAG root also acts as UDP server. The DAG nodes are UDP client. The clients
send a UDP request periodically, that simply includes a counter as payload.
When receiving a request, The server sends a response with the same counter
back to the originator.

The nodes implement an IDS to detect attacks coming from the network.
